# prework-study-guide

## Description

The Prework Study guide was built to help students or those considering a future in coding an easy step by step journey on getting started on their projects.  It contains notes that I found useful on the following; HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.  
The guide will give you an idea of the topics you need to study and how they are "written".
As an example, when using HTML there is a guide to how you construct the page by using header, sections and footer and how to insert an image within the website you are creating.
You will like me encounter problems but my advice is not to panic.  I used websites such as stack Overflow to help me answer quite a few of the issues that I came across.  Always as check your code, I experienced issues, simply because had placed a dot in the wrong place!
The building of the Prework Study Guide, was incredibily useful in getting used to all the new languages and platforms you need to use to help you on your journey.  I learnt an awful lot in the short period I have been doing this and feel more motivated in continuing and learning more.
