          <ul>
            <li> JS programming language that allows users to interact with websites</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Core feature being VARIABLES, which stores data tupes as values</li>
            <li>A VARIABLE is a named container, that allows us to store data in our code</code> </li>
            <li>To declare a Variable, we must give this a unique name</li>
            <li>The Variable can contain strings, each string is contained within quotation marks</li>
            <li> To access string use Variables unique name</li>
            <li> I norder to see changes use Chrome DevTools, this is a developers tool.</li>
            <li> Chrome DevTools allows you to test your code and de-bug any code thats written</li>
            <li> Conditional statements such as "if" will only excecute if the statement meets a condition or if it is true </li>
            <li> "else if" statement can be used if there is more than one condition to be met</li>
            <li> "ARRAYS" are useful for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable></li>
            <li>individual data within an ARRAY has one more piece of information; the location of the data within the ARRAY; identified with unique number called an INDEX></li>
            <li> using each piece of data index, one is able to access individual dat inside an ARRAY</li>
            <li> create a loop with "for" followed by the code that we want executed for each loop within curly brackets</li>
            <li> "commenting out code" makes the code inactive without deleting it, incase its required later</li>
            <li> "Function" is a set of instructions to tell the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
            <li>A Function must be called by name i.e. "paint house", in order to excecute it.</li>
            <li>This can be reused as many times as the code is required</li>
            <li>A Functions name is followed by (), wrap the exisiting "if" statement in a function called "selectTopic()</li>
